# DNA-Decoder
Input a RNA sequence to find all possible amino acids based on the nucleotides. 
The User can either manually input an RNA string consisting of 'A', 'U', 'G', and 'C' or can randomly generate one by inputting the length of the string.
Once the algorithm is executed, the codons along with the amino acids are generated and can be saved as a text file called text.txt. If the 
User decides to type yes, then the file is written. Otherwise, the user may start over.
